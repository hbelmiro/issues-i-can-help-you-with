# Issues I can help you with

This is a repository for issues I'm involved with that are good for people who want to start contributing to Open Source.

## How to contribute

Just open a PR with the fix and add `@hbelmiro` (me) as a reviewer.

If you prefer to validate your solution before sending the PR, [send me a message](https://thegreatapi.com/social-media/) telling me about your plans.
